### What I learned

well, i didn't learn much to be honest, but what i did is practice what i have learnt, because almost everything (code) i wrote is what i've been learning and preparing for, but i'm happy doing the project because i was able to project a little of what's on my head on the computer, which was beautiful. Though i do learn a few things, like; how to change an application's theme and most importantly using the JavaScript manipulations its really amaizing, how to work with multiple classes; adding, removing and replacing them base on their function and other. All i have is that i'm happy i'm writing and making it work as it is suppose to or almost and i'm happy to finally put my learnings to practice. This is my first Officiall Project and i'm to make this first step towards my coding journey and projects to come, insha'ALLAH it's just the begining...

### Continued development

Well, for now i really want to focus on developing my Javascript Coding skills in my next projects.
